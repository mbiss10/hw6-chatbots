        all movies that have articles in their title. The processed title has
        the article moved to the front of the title, to create a more natural
        name.

        limitation of this that we are aware of is that some titles have non-
        English titles that also include articles, but we are not handling
        these cases right now. We checked all possible articles that appear

        file data/parsed_article_candidates.txt. This allowed us to confirm
        that A, An, and The should be sufficient for all English titles.
