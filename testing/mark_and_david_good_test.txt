Well, when I watched "Titanic" I cried out of boredom and thought it was the worst movie with Leo's ever been in.
1997
Despite what I just said about Titanic, I do like DeCaprio. "Catch Me if You Can" is amazing. Just such a great film.
Let's keep cruising on the Leo train. "Django Unchained" is fantastic. The music is unreal, the acting is great, and the ending is so satisfying.
"Transformers" sucks. It's terrible.
2007
My favorite movie of all time is "Limitless".
